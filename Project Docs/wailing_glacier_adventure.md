# The Wailing Glacier – Five-Room Dungeon

## Overview

- **Theme:** Survival horror, cold magic, trapped spirits  
- **Setting:** A frozen cavern system carved by ancient frost giants  
- **Tone:** Haunting, echoing, desolate

### Hook – Weeping on the Wind

Travellers have gone missing near a looming glacier above a remote village. When the wind blows down the valley, villagers swear they hear **weeping** carried on the gusts.

The elders remember half-forgotten tales of frost giants who **bound wicked spirits in ice** to use as servants and guardians. They ask the party to climb to the glacier, find the source of the voices, and put the dead to rest if they can.

## Room 1 – Ice Chasm (Guardian)

**Concept:** A precarious ledge over a deep crevasse; a frost-themed harpy tries to lure adventurers to their doom.

### Description

A cramped tunnel of rough rock and ice opens onto a **narrow, wind-blasted ledge** halfway up a vast blue-white chasm. The floor is a slick shelf of packed snow and glassy ice, no more than about a metre wide in places. Far below, the chasm disappears into a dim blue haze; echoes of dripping water and creaking ice rise from the depths.

Above, jagged icicles hang like teeth from the ceiling. A faint, sorrowful melody drifts on the icy air, at first indistinguishable from the wind—until it shapes into words that promise warmth, rest, and safety if you just come a little closer to the edge.

### Hazards

- **Narrow ledge:** Characters rushing, fighting, or shoved near the edge risk slipping and falling into the chasm.
- **Fall:** A fall deals **3d6 bludgeoning damage**, but soft drifts below prevent instant death. A secured **rope** or similar safety precautions can greatly reduce or negate this damage, and primarily threaten separation from the group.

### Enemy – Frost Harpy

A harpy whose feathers are rimed with frost and whose eyes glow faintly icy blue.

- Lurks on an icy outcrop above the ledge.
- Opens with **Luring Song**, trying to charm characters into walking towards the edge.
- Swoops down to claw or club rescuers and those who resist.
- May try to flee into the glacier if badly wounded, screeching warnings that echo deeper inside.

## Room 2 – Frozen Murals (Puzzle / Roleplay)

**Concept:** Frost giant murals and a magical frost ward; the party must show respect and use careful, non-destructive methods to pass.

### Description

The ledge eventually widens into a **cavern of pure blue ice**, lit by a ghostly inner glow. The walls are carved with murals of towering frost giants drawing wisps of soul-light from kneeling humanoids and binding them into great blocks of ice.

Across the far side of the chamber, an arched passage leads deeper into the glacier, but a thick sheet of **rippling, opalescent frost** seals it shut. Faded faces drift within the ice—distorted, open-mouthed, silently screaming. Encircling the portal are runes of binding in the frost giants’ tongue, indicating that the spirits within will react strongly to aggression.

### The Frost Ward

A veil of ancient giant magic bars the way.

- **Arcane clues:** Careful study of the runes suggests that **fire and brute force** will anger the trapped spirits, while calm, holy, or precise treatment can open the ward safely.
- **Good approaches:**
  - Casting **calm emotions** or similar magic on the wall, soothing the spirits and allowing the frost to relax and part.
  - Sprinkling **holy water** on key points of the mural, accompanied by a prayer or blessing.
  - Carefully tracing the correct **warding sigils** with a DC 14 Religion or Arcana check, inverting the binding without shattering it.
- **Bad approaches:**
  - Using sustained fire or repeated heavy blows to break the ice causes the faces to twist in agony, triggering a psychic backlash and priming the spirits to manifest more violently later.

Breaking the ward by force or fire leads to more or angrier spirits in the next chamber.

## Room 3 – Whispering Hall (Twist / Setback)

**Concept:** A suffocating corridor of whispers where spirits claw at the party’s minds; then will-o’-wisps attack.

### Description

Beyond the weakened or shattered ward, a **long, narrow hall** stretches ahead. The ice here is cloudy and veined with dark shapes like bodies frozen mid-struggle, hands reaching out from within the walls.

At first only a faint murmur is audible, like distant speech heard through water. As the party advances, the whispers grow louder and clearer—pleading, accusing, mocking. Some voices use the characters’ names; others echo their doubts and fears back at them.

### Psychic Pressure

As the party progresses, the spirits attempt to seize their thoughts:

- Each character must resist the mental onslaught or find their focus eroded by the constant barrage of alien memories and emotions.
- Those who falter struggle to aim blows and notice threats, their minds full of static and half-heard screams.

### Will-o’-Wisp Ambush

At the far end of the hall, the ice bulges and splits. Spheres of pale blue-white light squeeze out of the walls, crackling with cold energy—**Will-o’-Wisps** formed from the most malicious of the bound souls.

- They flicker between visibility and invisibility, darting through the walls.
- They strike with sudden **shocks of lightning-like energy**, then vanish again.
- Their glow pulses in time with the whispers, which continue to hiss throughout the fight.

The number and fury of the wisps can reflect how the party handled the ward back in Room 2.

## Room 4 – The Iceheart Guardian (Climax)

**Concept:** A massive crystal heart suspended in ice and a frozen ogre zombie bound to it as a guardian.

### Description

The corridor opens into a **cathedral-like vault** of ice. The ceiling arches high above, lost in darkness. In the centre of the chamber, suspended within a column of translucent ice, hangs a gigantic **crystal heart**—the **Iceheart**—pulsing with cold blue light that washes over the room in slow waves.

Embedded beneath it is a hulking ogre-sized corpse encased from neck to toe. Frost creeps over its corpse-pale skin and its eyes are shut. Runes of binding form chains of ice around its arms and chest, linking it directly to the Iceheart.

When the party approaches, the heart’s pulsing quickens. Cracks spread through the ice. With a shuddering roar, the shell explodes outward, showering the chamber in shards. The **Iceheart Guardian** lumbers free, trailing ghostly mist and ice fragments, its eyes aglow with the same eerie light as the crystal above.

### The Guardian

A reskinned **Ogre Zombie** infused with the Iceheart’s power:

- Its blows radiate **freezing cold**, slowing those it strikes.
- The Iceheart’s energy fuels its **unnatural endurance**, making it hard to keep down.
- It focuses first on whoever threatens the heart directly or stands closest to the pillar.

Optional environmental touches:

- The floor is slick with hoarfrost in places.
- Heavy impacts cause showers of ice dust from above, emphasising the instability of the chamber.

## Room 5 – The Iceheart’s Secret (Reward / Revelation)

**Concept:** The Iceheart contains the trapped souls; the party chooses between freeing them (safer, kinder) or taking the heart for personal gain.

### Description

With the guardian destroyed, the chamber falls eerily still. The Iceheart continues to pulse, but the rhythm has become panicked and uneven, like a frightened heartbeat.

Up close, countless **tiny faces** can be seen within the crystal—villagers, travellers, and ancient figures, pressed together like insects in amber. Some appear peaceful, others are locked in silent screams. A ring of old frost giant runes wraps the base of the Iceheart, interwoven with clumsy, more recent etchings where others have tried and failed to meddle with the prison.

The weeping heard on the wind clearly originates here.

### Choice 1 – Free the Spirits

- With careful study and the right knowledge or faith, the binding can be undone.
- A successful unbinding causes the Iceheart to **fracture gently**, the shards dissolving into harmless motes of light.
- The spirits swirl around the party in a bright spiral, murmuring their thanks before ascending and fading away.
- Treasure and relics frozen in the ice for centuries are left behind, along with the gratitude of the nearby village which offers the party lifelong hospitality.

### Choice 2 – Take the Iceheart

- The party can simply smash or pry the Iceheart free as loot.
- Doing so causes a violent **eruption of spiritual energy**: howling winds and a storm of ghostly figures tearing through the chamber.
- The spirits disperse in a chaotic rush with no understanding of the party’s intentions, leaving an uneasy quiet.
- Among the glittering shards remain valuable crystal fragments and a single **Iceheart Shard**, still humming with cold power, capable of absorbing cold magic once per day.

Upon returning to the village, the disappearances stop, but rumours spread about the adventurers who **stole the glacier’s heart**, leaving a morally ambiguous legacy behind them.
