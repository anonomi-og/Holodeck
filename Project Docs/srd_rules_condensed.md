## Core Mechanics

### Ability Scores & Modifiers

- **Topic:** ability scores
- **Category:** core
- **Summary:** Characters have six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma). Each score has a modifier that influences rolls.
- **Key Mechanics:**
  - Modifiers are derived from scores (e.g. 10–11 → +0, 12–13 → +1, 14–15 → +2, etc.).
  - When a rule says "add your Strength modifier", you add the modifier, not the raw score.

### Ability Checks

- **Key Mechanics:**
  - Roll **1d20 + relevant ability modifier**.
  - Add proficiency bonus if the character is proficient in the related skill or tool.
